This project uses React/Typescript, eslint/prettier, and Sass/BEM. It is deployed to Netlify and takes advantage of their lambda's so we can have proxy routes help to obscure our api calls.

# To run the project locally

Simply use `npm run dev`. This will start the client and also the lambda server.

# To run the tests

This project has two tests using React Testing Library, to run it use `npm run test`
